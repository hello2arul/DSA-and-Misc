The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at 
which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       â†‘   â†‘
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
