Initial Question: You are given an n√óm grid and start from the bottom-left corner 
with the goal of reaching the bottom-right corner. The allowed moves are only to 
the right, diagonally up-right, and diagonally down-right. The task is to determine
the total number of unique paths that can lead you from the starting point to the 
destination while adhering to these movement rules.

Follow-Up 1: A list of specific checkpoints within the grid is now introduced.
In this variation, you are required to count only those paths that pass 
through each of these checkpoints once before reaching the bottom-right corner.


Follow-Up 2: The order of visiting these checkpoints is now specified.
For example, if the checkpoints are labeled 1, 2, and 3, any valid path
must encounter checkpoint 1 first, then checkpoint 2, and finally checkpoint 3,
in that exact sequence, on its way to the destination.
